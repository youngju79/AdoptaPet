        <p class="fs-5">
            The goal of this web application is to simplify the process of adopting/listing a pet for adoption. Using a simple and intuitive design,

            along with the contact information of the pets' owners. All of the pets' information (breed type, age, etc.) will also be displayed. Registered 
            users of the application will be able to put their pets up for adoption, while unregistered users will only be able to view a list of pets that 
            are up for adoption. Users who choose to sign in are also able to favorite pets that they are interested in.
